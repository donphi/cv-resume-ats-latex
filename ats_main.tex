\section{PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY}
Systems architect with 15+ years designing end-to-end data and operational architecture across finance, healthcare, and applied Artificial Intelligence (AI). The same core capability in every domain: mapping complete paths from raw input to verified output and ensuring architectural integrity at every layer---whether that is a \$2.1M financial data platform, a foreign healthcare system navigated under life-threatening constraints, or a 99.91\%-accurate document processing pipeline running on dual NVIDIA B200 GPUs with full provenance. I build systems where the signal cannot mutate between the point of origin and the point of use.

\section{RESEARCH EXPERIENCE}

\textbf{MSc Researcher --- Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Digital Health} \hfill Sep 2024 -- Present\\
University of Westminster \hfill London, UK

Integrated platform for ingesting, structuring, validating, and indexing scientific literature at scale. Designed as a single deterministic system with reproducibility, provenance, and hardware efficiency as architectural requirements.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em, itemsep=2pt, parsep=0pt]
  \item \textbf{Platform Architecture \& Orchestration:} 23-stage deterministic pipeline orchestrated via Prefect with distributed execution through RabbitMQ worker queues and hardware-aware compute profiles
  \item 6,636 documents / 100,034 pages at 99.91\% success, producing contract-valid structured JSON with full provenance (manifests, hashing, structured logging, stage-level contracts)
  \item Sustained dual NVIDIA B200 GPUs at 90--96\% utilisation and CPUs at 56--65\% for 52 continuous hours, generating \textasciitilde1 TB across 2 million files with zero pipeline failure
  \item 181 Docker containers and 11 Natural Language Processing (NLP) models concurrently; all hyperparameters grid-searched with confusion matrix validation for high F1. No models fine-tuned---performance achieved through architectural discipline
  \item \textbf{Ontology \& Search Layer:} Parsed and normalised biomedical ontologies (Mondo Disease Ontology (MONDO), Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO)) into queryable graph structures (DuckDB) for defensible disease labelling and filtering
  \item Parallel-processing Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) to index semantically chunked documents and extracted entities into Elasticsearch and PostgreSQL for high-recall retrieval and analytics
  \item \textbf{Human-in-the-Loop Validation \& Quality Assurance:} SapBERT embedding similarity to propose and rank candidate feature aliases, with Flask application serving Machine Learning (ML)-ranked suggestions for expert approval/rejection
  \item Evaluation methodology using stratified sampling and confusion matrices to quantify extraction and linking accuracy and guide thresholding
  \item Outputs feed verified training datasets for downstream model evaluation---closing the loop from raw document to validated, reusable knowledge
  \item \textbf{UK Biobank Large-Scale Data Extraction:} Faculty stated extracting the full UK Biobank feature set across the 500,000-participant cohort was impossible. Read the entire DNA Nexus manual and identified a viable extraction path
  \item Actual feature space was approximately 50,000 (not the assumed 10,000) including all arrays and instances. Pulled the complete dataset---50,000 features \texttimes\ 500,000 participants---into 15 parquet files totalling 42 GB
  \item Optimised extraction from 15 hours to 30 minutes---a 30\texttimes\ improvement through architectural understanding of the platform, not brute compute
\end{itemize}

\section{WORK EXPERIENCE}

\textbf{Chief Operating Officer \& Board Member} \hfill Mar 2023 -- Feb 2024\\
Rootstock Investment Management \hfill Remote (London, UK)
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em, itemsep=2pt, parsep=0pt]
  \item Owned operating model across technology, governance, and analytics in a regulated, high-accountability investment environment
  \item Directed delivery of automated research and reporting workflows; improved reliability of operational processes and controls
  \item Oversaw risk and governance tooling, ensuring consistent process execution and auditability across teams
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Career Break --- Organ Transplant \& Recovery} \hfill Feb 2019 -- Mar 2023\\
Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania \hfill Philadelphia, USA
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em, itemsep=2pt, parsep=0pt]
  \item Became the 141st person globally to receive a combined double-lung and liver transplant---a 16-hour surgical procedure requiring a two-year pre-transplant wait during peak COVID-19, compared to a typical wait of three to six months
  \item Navigated the entire US healthcare system independently as a foreign national, systematically analysing policy, administrative process, and insurance structures to identify a viable coverage pathway
  \item Endured 38 years of chronic illness prior to transplant. The same persistence and systems-level problem-solving demonstrated throughout this CV was forged under those conditions
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Senior Partner / Project Officer} \hfill Jan 2014 -- Feb 2019\\
Rootstock Investment Management \hfill Stellenbosch, South Africa
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em, itemsep=2pt, parsep=0pt]
  \item Delivered the firm's core reporting and data platform (\textasciitilde\$2.1M budget): authored complete technical specifications from raw data capture through processing logic to portal and report outputs---the first platform of its kind in South Africa's boutique investment sector
  \item Built foundational IT and reporting infrastructure: automated analytics, real-time dashboards, and operational monitoring designed for reliability and business continuity
  \item Directed a 7,000 sq ft European office expansion across engineering, architecture, and IT; identified and corrected design and implementation failures from the architect, interior designer, and IT manager before build
  \item Managed multidisciplinary teams, consistently driving system reliability and data integrity as primary operational requirements
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Co-Founder \& Project Manager} \hfill Jun 2017 -- Feb 2019\\
FundCo \hfill Stellenbosch, South Africa
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em, itemsep=2pt, parsep=0pt]
  \item Raised \$1M seed funding and led an 8-person development team from specification through to deployment of a financial comparison platform
  \item Wrote complete technical specifications and managed delivery against scope, cost, and timeline---delivered under budget and ahead of schedule
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Technical Analyst / Systems Lead} \hfill Oct 2008 -- Jan 2014\\
Rootstock Investment Management \hfill Stellenbosch, South Africa
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em, itemsep=2pt, parsep=0pt]

  \item Built systematic analysis frameworks for FX and multi-asset strategies producing consistent returns over an 11-year track record
  \item Designed all business continuity and disaster recovery plans; built the firm's foundational IT and reporting infrastructure from zero
\end{itemize}
