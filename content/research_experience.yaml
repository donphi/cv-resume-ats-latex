    description: >-
      Multi-year research programme investigating the feasibility of fusing
      hip-hop vocal delivery, punk energy systems, and heavy metal

      Results shipped commercially as 'Significant Other' and 'Chocolate
      Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water'---combined 30M+ units.
    subsections:
      - heading: "Genre Fusion Pipeline Architecture"
        bullets:

          - "Achieved genre-blend ratios of 40% hip-hop / 35% metal / 25% punk on 'Rollin'' and 'Nookie'---validated by 15M+ single sales and 200+ weeks on Billboard charts"
          - "Pioneered DJ-integrated metal performance architecture with DJ Lethal, processing 120+ BPM turntable samples synchronised to drop-D guitar tuning in real time"

      - heading: "Large-Scale Audience Response Testing"
        bullets:
          - "Conducted the largest live audience stress test in nu-metal history at Woodstock '99: 400,000 concurrent participants, 72-hour sustained engagement window"
          - "Measured peak crowd energy output during 'Break Stuff' at an estimated 2.4 MW of kinetic force across the mosh pit zone---the highest recorded metric for the genre"
          - "Post-event analysis identified critical failure modes in venue crowd-flow architecture; published findings informally via MTV interview (1999)"

      - heading: "Cross-Platform Distribution & Format Compatibility"
        bullets:
          - "Validated output compatibility across CD, cassette, MiniDisc, and early MP3 distribution channels simultaneously---one of the first acts to release a free MP3 single ('N 2 Gether Now') to drive physical sales"
          - "Reverse-engineered Napster distribution metrics to quantify piracy impact; used data to negotiate improved royalty structures with Interscope"
