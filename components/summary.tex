Systems architect with 15+ years designing end-to-end data and operational architecture across finance, healthcare, and applied AI. The same core capability in every domain: mapping complete paths from raw input to verified output and ensuring architectural integrity at every layer---whether that is a \$2.1M financial data platform, a foreign healthcare system navigated under life-threatening constraints, or a 99.91\%-accurate document processing pipeline running on dual NVIDIA B200 GPUs with full provenance. I build systems where the signal cannot mutate between the point of origin and the point of use.
